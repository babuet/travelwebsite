      never gets boring. It's a city that checks all the boxes: culture, food, beauty,
      parks, museums and awesome people. You can still feel the freedom, liberation and
      marijuana scent in the parks, but surely the city has change a lot since the Summer

  <h2>New Orleans</h2>
  <h3>For the music lovers</h3>
    <p>Very different from any other city in the United States, New Orleans is the result of
      the a mix of influences and events throughout the history. Being at first colonised
      France and then taken over by the Spanish colons, the european heritage is mixed with
      the African influence of the slaves that were brought back in the day, deriving in the
      creole culture that you can breathe in the streets.</p>
    <p>Music, gastronomy, architecture and history are just some of the reasons why
       you should visit this incredible and unique city.</p>

  <h2>Vancouver Island</h2>
  <h3>For the nature enthusiasts</h3>
    <p>Breathtaking views, rainforests and incredible trails are some
      the reasons that drive travelers to this massive island. Nature lovers, excitement-
      seekers, those who want to avoid crowds, listen up because this may be the place for you.</p>
    <p>This wonderful place is part of Britich Columbia, in Canada, and we like
      because it's a different option, not as exploited as many other places, and has
      so much to offer.</p>
    <p>Easy to get there from Vancouver or Richmond, taking a ferry you'll see yourself in the island
      before you even realise. Although the capital, Victoria, has lovely parks, restaurants and going
      for a stroll is more than recommended, our top picks require renting a car and explore the island.</p>
