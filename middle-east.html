      <p class='lead'>Very different from any other city in the United States, New Orleans is the result of
        the a mix of influences and events throughout the history. Being at first colonised
        France and then taken over by the Spanish colons, the european heritage is mixed with
        the African influence of the slaves that were brought back in the day, deriving in the
        creole culture that you can breathe in the streets.</p>
      <p class='lead'>Music, gastronomy, architecture and history are just some of the reasons why
         you should visit this incredible and unique city.</p>

    <h2 class='featurette-heading'>The Dead Sea <span class='text-muted'>For a unique bathing experience</span></h2>
      <p class='lead'>A one-of-a-kind seaside experience, the Dead Sea has the highest concentration of salt in its water,
        hence the reason why if you go swimming here, you will float.</p>
      <p class='lead'>This wonderful place is part of Britich Columbia, in Canada, and we like it
        because it's a different option, not as exploited as many other places, and has
        so much to offer.</p>
      <p class='lead'>Easy to get there from Vancouver or Richmond, taking a ferry you'll see yourself in the island
        before you even realise. Although the capital, Victoria, has lovely parks, restaurants and going
        for a stroll is more than recommended, our top picks require renting a car and explore the island.</p>
